## Compilation Instructions:
Psych Engine insists (rightfully) that you must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/).
For this mod specifically, it was made using [Haxe 4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/), so it is mostly recommended you use that. Newer versions will probably work, not too sure though, I'm not going into this much detail whatsoever.
